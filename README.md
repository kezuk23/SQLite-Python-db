Scenario
You are a freelance software engineer who is newly hired by a client. The client does not understand programming and has given you a half working programme which is full of bugs written by their previous software engineer who is now fired. The client is now asking you to fix it. The client doesn't care how you fix it but just wants a program that allows them or their admin to manipulate the data and have the features mentioned in the assignment below. They would be pleased if you added any extra features in addition to the ones mentioned below.
The requirements of the program
You are to create (edit/rewrite) a program that allows management of employees’ data for ABC company. The program should provide a means for the admin of the company to enter the following information:
● Title (Mr, Mrs, Dr, ...)
● Forename
● Surname
● Email address
● Salary
The admin should be able to create an employee table that has the above fields. When the table is created, the program should display a warning message on the screen “This table is already created”. Then the admin should be able to insert employee data, search and show all data into a database on the screen. Additionally, if they want to amend some records, they should be able to do it on this program.
